Searching Algorithms

1. Algorithm - Specific step/procedure taken to solve a problem or compute a problem
             - Should be finite 
             - Domain specific 
             - Step-wise procedure 
             - Problem statement should be as clear as possible in order to come up with the correct algorithm 

2. Sorting and Searching go Together 
    - Without sorting your search is bound to be sequential 
3. Key terms 
    - data 
    - DFS (pre-order, in-order, post-order), BFS, BST etc.
    - Index 
    - Search Hit or Search Miss 
    - indices tables (for storing indexes)

4. GENERAL MEHTODS OF SEARCH 
    - Linear 
        - Sequantial and Random
    - Binary (BST and Binary Heap)
        - Ordered and Non-sequential 
5. EFFICIENT METHODS FOR SEARCHING 
    - Binary Search 
    - Hash Table 
    - Red-Black Tree 
    - Binary Heap

NOTES:
    - there is an extra cost needed to keep data sorted when inserting and deleting an item from the list 
    - Searching a Linked list and BST
    - Searching a Matrix 
    - Searching a graph (DFS and BFS)
