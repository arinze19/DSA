# Happy Number

**Description**

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy. A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 
1. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
2. Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
3. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
4. Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

**sample input**

```javascript
const n = 19;
```

**sample output**

```javascript
true;
```

**runtime and space complexity**
