# Selection Sort

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a
sorted version of that array. use the selection sort algorithm to sort the array

**Sample Input**

```javascript
const array = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6];
```

**Sample Output**

```javascript
[-4, -1, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11];
```

**Space and Time Complexity**

```
The optimal time and space complexity for this program is O(n^2) - time | O(1) - space
```
