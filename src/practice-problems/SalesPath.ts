The car manufacturer Honda holds their distribution system in the form of a tree (not necessarily binary).
The root is the company itself, and every node in the tree represents a car distributor that receives cars from the parent node and ships them to its children nodes. 
The leaf nodes are car dealerships that sell cars direct to consumers. 
In addition, every node holds an integer that is the cost of shipping a car to it.

Take for example the tree below:
     0
