# Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

**Sample Input**

```typescript
const Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2];
```

**Sample Output**

```typescript
4;
```

**Runtime & Space Complexity**

```
O(n)
```
