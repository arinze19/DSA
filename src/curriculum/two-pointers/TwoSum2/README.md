# Two Sum II

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

**Sample Input**

```javascript
const numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
```

**Sample Output**

```javascript
[1, 2];
```

**Time and Space Complexity**

```markdown
O(n) - time | O(1) - space
```
