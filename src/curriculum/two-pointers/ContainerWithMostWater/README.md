# Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0`) and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

**Sample Input**

```javascript
const height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7];
```

**Sample Output**

```javascript
49;
```
