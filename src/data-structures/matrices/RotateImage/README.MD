# Rotate Image 

You are given an `n x n` 2D `matrix` representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

***Sample Input***

```typescript
const matrix: number[][] = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
```

***Sample Output***

```typescript 
[[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```
