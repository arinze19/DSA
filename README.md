# DSA-in-ts

notes and practice questions to prepare for my technical interviews

## Structure

The `src` folder is divied up into three sections.

1. algorithms: Implementation of mainstream algorithms
2. curriculum: Structures learning curriculum and practice questions based of [neetcode](https://neetcode.io)
3. practice: Practice questions

The `CPE` folder is a separate dedicated folder for notes on inner logic and computer science fundamentals (typically written in C++)

```

Please feel free to fork the [REPO](https://github.com/arinze19/DSA-in-ts.git) or open up a [PR](https://github.com/arinze19/DSA-in-ts/pulls) with new ideas.

## Side Note

Although this repository primarily serves `typescript` solutions, I occasionally write `c++` solutions as well to take a slightly higher control of memory management and runtime.
