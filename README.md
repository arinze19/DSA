# About 
This REPO contains code samples of popular algorithms and data structures solved in TypeScript (complied to JavaScript) to further enhance my understanding of DSA by explaining it in a way that a 5 year old could understand

# Structure 
This REPO contains 3 folder - `__test__`, `src` and `public`. The TypeScript code lives in the `src` folder which is then configured to be transpiled to vanilla JS in the `public` folder. 
The `__test__` folder contains test files to run each data-structure, algorithm and practice-problem.
